### Hi there 👋

I love learning and working with data :bowtie:. I live in San Francisco and have held several data related roles in my professional experience.

In the winter of 2020, I joined a data science bootcamp at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) where I completed several machine learning projects in python – check them out below. I've also written a couple of blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@corraljrmiguel).  

More recently, I've built some Python web scrapers for fun.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelcorraljr/) or reach out at <corraljrmiguel@gmail.com>.
