I'm a data analyst and project manager. I love working with data at every stage including data collection, engineering, analysis, modeling, and visualization. 

A few things I've done:

- 🤖 Built web scrapers to fetch data from TED, Y Combinator, Doctoralia, Yahoo Sports, and more.
- 🌐 Published 5 high-quality datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/miguelcorraljr/datasets).
- 🎨 Created an extension for Visual Studio Code – [JupyterLab Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MiguelCorralJr.jupyterlab-light-theme).
