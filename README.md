### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist/analyst in San Francisco and I love learning and working with data. :bowtie:

In the winter of 2020, I joined a data science bootcamp at [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) where I completed several machine learning projects in python â€“ check them out below. 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelcorraljr/) or reach out at <corraljrmiguel@gmail.com>.
